# Multilingual-Deep-Neural-Math-Word-Problem-Solver

This project, develops a language agnostic math word problem solver through the implementation of deep learning-based methods. It  utilizes  subsets  of  two  multilingual  large-scale datasets, Math23K (Chinese language) and Dolphin-S (English language), to train and test a language-agnostic model.
